# Corner Grocer CS210

## Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

The Corner Grocer app was created to provide a simple solution to a problem. The app is created in C++ with Python integration. The Corner Grocer app helps generate a list of products and their quantities, displays the frequency of each product, and also creates a histogram of sales data. It provides tools to help populate data for management.

## What did you do particularly well?

When I created the app, I wanted it to be clean and easy to read. So I decided to use a case switch that called upon separate functions. I was trying to stray away from clutter, and I think I did a pretty well job of it.

## Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

I could have done better with the way the menu system works. Originally, I was going to clear the screen after a new selection was made, just to make things a little easier to read. I decided to leave it be, just in case the user needed to scroll up to reference something.

## Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

When writing my python code for the integration, I kept getting read violation errors and couldn't figure it out at the time. I remember having this issue before and decided to reference my old python material from a previous term as this has occured to me before. Utilizing resources, whether online or work that you have done before, are essential tools to add to your support network.

## What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

I believe that everything that involved coding/programming is definitely transferable to other programming languages. I would just need to familiarize myself with the syntax of the new language, and the rest would come pretty easy.

## How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I tried to keep a naming convention with all of my functions easy to read and understand from the start. I tried to also add comments to where they would matter the most.
